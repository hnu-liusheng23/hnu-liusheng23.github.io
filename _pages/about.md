I am a PhD researcher in computer science, working on **3D vision, point cloud reconstruction, and learning-based geometric modeling**. My research interests sit at the intersection of **point cloud completion, single-view 3D reconstruction, neural rendering, and representation learning for sparse and incomplete geometry**.

I am particularly interested in how 3D systems behave under *real-world sensing constraints*: partial observations, noise, missing regions, and scale ambiguity. Rather than assuming clean inputs, I focus on models and pipelines that are robust, interpretable, and practically useful.

My recent work includes:

* **Single-view 3D reconstruction** with decoupled representations
* **Point cloud completion** using coarse-to-fine generation and detail refinement
* **Multi-scale attention mechanisms** for geometry understanding
* **Alignment and normalization** of predicted point clouds against ground truth

I enjoy reading and re-implementing full research codebases to understand *why* a method works, not just *that* it works. Recent deep dives include models such as **SVDFormer** and **CRA-PCN**, where I analyze, refactor, and rename modules to better expose their underlying design logic.

This website serves as a lightweight academic notebook: a place to share publications, ongoing projects, technical notes, and experiments related to 3D reconstruction and point cloud learning.

## About this site

This site is built with **GitHub Pages** using the Academic Pages template. All content is maintained in simple Markdown and YAML files, version-controlled on GitHub. This keeps the site transparent, reproducible, and easy to extend—much like good research code.

Over time, this site will grow to include:

* Publications and preprints
* Research projects and code releases
* Technical notes on 3D vision and point cloud learning
* A dynamically generated academic CV
